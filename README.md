# delivery-time-analysis
 Data analysis project for a task.

 First an example database is set-up, and a specified SELECT query is used to find some data.
 Then I transferred the project into Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and exploratory analysis.

# Usage
 1. Local clone the repository
 2. To run the code, you need to create a MySQL database with the droptime.sql
 3. In the analysis directory, create a ".env" file with a "PASSWORD" variable equal to your MySQL database user password.
